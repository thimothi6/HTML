loops or iteration statements:
they run until the condition fails. each run is one iteration.

They are primirily two loops existed. 
1. entry control loops:
at entry only the condition will be checked
Eg: while, for
2. exit control loops:
condition will be checked after execution
Eg: do while

initialization; i=0
while(condition) i<10
{
    //code i
    updation i++
}


initalization
do{
    code
    updation
}while(condition)

//for loops
//standard for
for(initialization;condition;updation)
{
    //code
}
