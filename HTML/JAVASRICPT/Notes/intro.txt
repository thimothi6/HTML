 To know the data type of a variable, you can use operator "typeof()"

 5. Explain 'number' data type.
  any numerical values in Js , it automatically assigns number data type. Even decimals are also considered as number data type .

  There are some pre - defined methods for numbers
    1. var num=25.369;
    num.toFixed(2)---> it will round figure number into 2 decimal points.
    2. var num=26.3698
    num.toPrecision(3) ---> it will round figure number into only 3 digits from starting
    3.var num=25;
    num.toString(2) --> it will convert the given number into respected base number--> num into binary
